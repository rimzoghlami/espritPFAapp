# Models Directory

This directory contains model files representing the data structures used within the application. These models are typically TypeScript interfaces or classes that correspond to entities from the Spring Boot back-end.

## Structure
- `user.model.ts`: Represents the User entity.
- `workshop.model.ts`: Represents the Workshop entity.

Additional models can be added here as needed.
